## About The Project

[<img src="./images/website-screenshot.jpg" width="800"/>](image.png)

This is a project I was required to do as a part of a module within my HNC. This opportunity allowed me to learn more about flex boxes for positioning content on a webpage. I also learned how to style using SASS. I found SASS so much more convenient than CSS for this project as it allows styles to be split up into parts for each component.
